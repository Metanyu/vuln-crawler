        "Overview": "@ledgerhq/connect-kit is a malicious package. This package contains obfuscated crypto drainer code. This is a type of malware that executes unauthorized cryptocurrency transactions to transfer assets to attacker-controlled wallets. Note: To interface with Ledger's browser extension, decentralized application frontends (dApps) include a code snippet from Ledger, executed via a connect-kit-loader proxy. This proxy dynamically fetches and executes the latest version of connect-kit from npm. Hence, once the malicious versions were published to npm, any dApp using the official connect-kit-loader would inadvertently pull a malicious version when the user selected the Ledger Wallet Provider.
