        "Overview": "Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to NULL Pointer Dereference in the message handling code for IPv6 router solicitations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c . The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state. The message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. "
