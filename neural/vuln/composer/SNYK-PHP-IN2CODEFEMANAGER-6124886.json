        "Overview": "in2code/femanager is a Modern TYPO3 Frontend User Registration. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Control Bypass due to improper access permissions validation for the edit user component. An authenticated front-end user can use the vulnerability to either edit the data of various front-end users or delete various front-end user accounts. Another missing access check in the backend module of the extensions allows an authenticated backend user to perform various actions ( userLogout , confirmUser , refuseUser and resendUserConfirmation ) for any frontend user in the system.
