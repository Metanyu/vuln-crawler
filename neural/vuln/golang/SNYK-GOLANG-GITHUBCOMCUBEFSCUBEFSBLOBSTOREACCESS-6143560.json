An attacker that has successfully retrieved a secret key from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store or read sensitive data from the logs and escalate privileges. Note: The attacker can either be an internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or it can be an external user who has escalated privileges sufficiently to access the logs. "
