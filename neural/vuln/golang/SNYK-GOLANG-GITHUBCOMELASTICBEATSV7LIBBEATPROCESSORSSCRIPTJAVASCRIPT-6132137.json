An attacker can gain access to sensitive or private information by inducing the application to log events at the WARN or ERROR level. ",
        "Workaround": "This log line is logged at the WARN level; changing the log level to ERROR will suppress these logs. For Beats and standalone Elastic Agent the log level can be changed in the configuration file, see: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-logging.html#level https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-standalone-logging-config.html "
